# ![nf-core Extension Pack](logo_wide.png)

**An extension pack for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with all the tools you'll need to develop with [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/)**, a community effort to collect a curated set of analysis pipelines built using Nextflow.

Note - not all of these may be to your taste! We have tried to include packages that people in the community have found useful, but be prepared to disable any that you don't like the look of after installing ;)
